You need to have the following packages:
- pandas
- gurobi
- plotly

How to use this:
- Unzip the folder and fire up Jupyter Notebook. Whatever you need to change is in the Notebook.
  You'll see the parameters to set up on top of the Notebook
  That's what you can play with and see the changes in the model.
- When you're done with the parameters, just select "Cell>Run All" and you should see the result.
- When you're done, the best way to close the Notebook is to click "File>Close and Halt". 
  That way you ensure nothing is running in the background and consuming your memory and also.
- If you want to clear the output of the notebook and not save it with the solution, 
  click on "Kernel>Restart & Clear Output". After that, save the notebook and close it as mentioned above.
- There are several other Python ("*.py") files. Two of them ('plots.py' and 'utils.py') are helper modules.
  They are used for helping load the data and also plot the networks. That means, if you need to share the files
  with someone else, you must provide them with the Notebook, the two mentioned python files, and the excel file ('*.xlsx).
  The other one ('execute.py') is the python script equivalent of the Jupyter Notebook. 
  This is for those who do not want to use Jupyter Notebook (for example, they can run the script 
  using command prompt or in an IDE like PyCharm).
- An important note about the excel file: Make sure the name of the columns and sheets are as seen in that file.
